# AI & Prompt Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This README highlights my journey and expertise in prompt engineering, generative AI, and agentic AI systems using cutting-edge frameworks and tools.

---

## 🧠 **Prompt Engineering**
- Mastered crafting effective prompts for LLMs (GPT-3/4, Claude, etc.)
- Techniques: zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and context management
- Optimized prompts for accuracy, safety, and creativity

## 🤖 **Generative AI**
- Built applications leveraging LLMs for text, code, and data generation
- Integrated models via APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face)
- Fine-tuned models for domain-specific tasks

## 🕸️ **Agentic AI & Frameworks**
### **LangChain**
- Developed multi-step reasoning agents
- Chained LLMs with tools (search, code, APIs)
- Implemented memory, retrieval, and tool use

### **LangGraph**
- Designed complex agent workflows as graphs
- Managed stateful, multi-agent interactions

### **CrewAI**
- Coordinated teams of specialized agents for collaborative tasks
- Orchestrated agent roles, communication, and task delegation

### **AutoGen**
- Automated agent creation and management
- Built self-improving agent systems

### **AgentOps**
- Monitored, evaluated, and optimized agent performance
- Ensured reliability and safety in agentic workflows
