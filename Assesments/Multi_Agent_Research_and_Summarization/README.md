# ðŸ§  Multi-Agent Research and Summarization Assistant

This project is a fully agentic research assistant built with Streamlit, LangChain, LangGraph, and Google Gemini. It can answer questions by searching the web, retrieving from your own documents, or using the Gemini LLMâ€”then summarizes the results for you.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Pipeline:**  
  Routes your query to the best agent: Web Search, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), or LLM.
- **Document Support:**  
  Upload PDFs, DOCX, or TXT files to the `rag` folder for custom knowledge retrieval.
- **Web Search Integration:**  
  Uses DuckDuckGo for real-time web answers.
- **Gemini LLM:**  
  Uses Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for reasoning and summarization.
- **Automatic Summarization:**  
  All answers are summarized for clarity.
- **Streamlit UI:**  
  Simple web interface for asking questions and viewing answers.

## How the Code Works

1. **Configuration & LLM Setup**
   - Loads your Google Gemini API key from `.env`.
   - Initializes Gemini LLM and embedding model.

2. **File Parsing**
   - Reads all `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.txt` files in the `rag` folder.
   - Splits documents into chunks and creates a FAISS vector store for retrieval.

3. **Agents**
   - **Router Agent:** Decides if the query should go to Web Search, RAG, or LLM.
   - **Web Agent:** Uses DuckDuckGo to answer.
   - **RAG Agent:** Retrieves from your documents and answers using Gemini.
   - **LLM Agent:** Answers directly using Gemini.
   - **Summarizer Agent:** Summarizes the answer.

4. **LangGraph Workflow**
   - Orchestrates the flow: Router â†’ (Web/RAG/LLM) â†’ Summarizer.

5. **Streamlit App**
   - Loads documents (if any).
   - Accepts user questions.
   - Runs the agentic workflow and displays the summarized answer.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd Assesments/Multi_Agent_Research_and_Summarization
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *If you see errors about missing packages, also run:*
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit langchain langgraph pdfplumber python-docx faiss-cpu google-generativeai duckduckgo-search python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Set up your Google Gemini API key**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
     ```
   - Get your key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

4. **(Optional) Add your documents**
   - Place `.pdf`, `.docx`, or `.txt` files in a folder named `rag` in the project directory.

## Running the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

- Open the provided local URL in your browser.
- Enter your question and click **Submit**.
- The app will display a summarized answer, using web search, your documents, or Gemini as appropriate.

---

## Notes

- If no documents are found, the app uses a small fallback knowledge base.
- Make sure your `.env` file is **not** committed to GitHub for security.
- The app is modular and easy to extend with more agents or tools.
