# üìù Smart Content Creation: Agentic AI Content Refinement

This Streamlit app simulates a conversation between two AI agents‚Äîa Content Creator and a Content Critic‚Äîpowered by Google Gemini and AutoGen. The Creator drafts and revises technical content, while the Critic provides structured feedback, resulting in high-quality, markdown-formatted educational material.

## Features

- **Agentic Collaboration:**  
  - Content Creator Agent: Drafts and revises technical content on a chosen topic.
  - Content Critic Agent: Evaluates content for technical accuracy, clarity, and depth, and suggests improvements.
- **LLM-Powered:**  
  Uses Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for all content generation and critique.
- **Interactive UI:**  
  Choose your topic and number of conversation turns, then watch the agents refine the content in real time.
- **Markdown Output:**  
  All content is structured in markdown for easy reuse.

   - Select the number of conversation turns.
   - Click **Start Simulation** to watch the agents collaborate and refine the content.

## How It Works

- The app uses two agent classes (Creator and Critic), each with a system prompt and access to Gemini via LangChain.
- On each turn, the Creator generates or revises content, and the Critic provides feedback.
- The process repeats for the selected number of turns, simulating iterative content refinement.
- All interactions and outputs are displayed in the Streamlit interface.

## Security

- **Never share your `.env` or API key publicly.**
- The `.gitignore` file should exclude `.env` and virtual environments.
