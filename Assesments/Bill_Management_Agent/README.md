## How It Works

- The app loads your Gemini API key and initializes the Gemini Vision model.
- When you upload a bill image, the model extracts expenses and groups them by category.
- AutoGen agents simulate a workflow: bill processing, categorization, and summarization.
- The results and agent interactions are displayed in the Streamlit UI.
