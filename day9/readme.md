# Conversion Obstacle Analyzer üîç

An AI-powered system that autonomously identifies and resolves hidden friction points in website user journeys to improve conversion outcomes.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Many websites, despite being visually appealing, suffer from high bounce rates due to hidden friction points in the user journey. This tool helps identify and resolve these issues using multiple AI agents.

## ü§ñ Key Features

### Multi-Agent System
- **User Flow Simulation Agent**: Emulates different user personas navigating the site
- **Friction Detection Agent**: Identifies high-drop-off elements and confusion points
- **Benchmarking Agent**: Uses RAG to compare against industry best practices
- **UX Optimization Agent**: Provides actionable UI/UX improvements

### Technologies Used
- LangChain for agent orchestration
- Google Gemini for AI processing
- FAISS for vector storage
- FastAPI for backend API
- Streamlit for user interface
